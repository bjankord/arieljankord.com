## What I Do
Currently, I am a K-5 STEM teacher in Kansas. Previously, I taught 1st, 2nd, and 4th grade. I advocate for making STEM, and more specifically, computer science, integrated in the elementary scene. I am the founder of the Johnson County Edcamp.

I am an ISTE Certified Educator and received the Making It Happen award in 2019.

Along with this, I am an Apple Teacher, Google Certified Educator, Microsoft Innovative Educator, Seesaw Ambassador, and Flipgrid Certified. I also serve as an ISTE PLN leader for Computer Science.

### I teach
I became a teacher because I loved working kids and seeing them light up when they learned something new. My passion for education has grown to create a space for ALL kids to explore, be creative, develop their passions, and become good humans.

### I speak
From tools to best practices, I am passionate about sharing how technology integration can transform learning for students. As a current teacher, everything I share is straight out of the classroom.

### I write
I choose to share my story because Iâ€™m in trenches. It is a time for me to reflect on my practice, but I also hope to shine a positive light on education by telling my story.
